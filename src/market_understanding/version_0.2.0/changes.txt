Redefined insights (Hover text in bubbles and squares) 

Insights now pops up vertically instead of horizontally

Insights shows market strength i.e. total weightage and wightage breakdown

For faster uploads using big data used plotly's GPU rendering (scattergl)

For live streaming charts historical calculations done only for the first time when chart loads and calculations for the live data appended as new data arrives.

Added a new type of static TPO chart. Static TPO with range slider. Unlike PLotly's default slider bar, this one uses Dash's range slider. The big difference is it dynamically updates Y-axis so after the zooming chart wouldn't look dwarfed.
