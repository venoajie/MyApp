An end-to-end Platform.
Data Feed: Services that connect to real-time data and feed the strategy portfolio.
Historical Data: Download historical data for research and testing purposes.
DataBase: Database to store everything and access it at any time.
Broker: Trading connections to any broker.
Portfolio: Strategies that we combine with one another and between assets to control the profit-risk binomial.
ETLs: Processes for downloading daily data and training models.
Dashboards: Monitors that provide us with information about our modelsâ€™ behavior.
Basktesting: Library to simulate the portfolio with historical data.
Alert-system: Real-time alert system. Do we want to know when an operation is completed or if a service is unavailable due to an unforeseen event?
Event-driven: Event-driven architecture, it is similar to a video game in which the character moves and triggers events that cause reactions from other characters or the appearance of new scenarios; in this case, we model and generate buy and sell signals based on the events that come to us from various data sources. To make them a reality, we must orchestrate a number of necessary components.
Statistical-edge: Most importantly, there is little we can do without a mathematical edge of the model we want to implement.
